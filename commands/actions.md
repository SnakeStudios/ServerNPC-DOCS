console give the player 1 grass block

/npc action test add true none cmd:give %player% grass\_block 1 \(Permission Dosen't matter because Console have all the permissions - DON'T use the Negetive Permision '!'\) \('/' Is NOT NEEDED if the command enterer is Console 'true' - Console is not a player to use '/'\)

### MSG:
